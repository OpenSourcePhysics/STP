  <h2>Chapter 10: It is About Time: Time-Dependent Phenomena</h2>

  <p>Thermodynamics describes  equilibrium time-independent phenomena. Even though thermodynamic processes are important, 
  thermodynamics    does not say anything about the time dependence of these processes. 
  These processes are analyzed by considering quasi-static processes where systems go from
  one equilibrium state to another and the time is irrelevant.      </p>
  
  <p>However, even in equilibrium there are time dependent quantities such as the mean squared displacement of a particle  and the velocity autocorrelation function. In addition, we  can study near equilibrium quantities
  such as the thermal conductivity for which there is a temperature gradient and the viscosity when there is a velocity 
  gradient in the system. Molecular dynamics simulations are useful for studying these time-dependent phenomena.
