<p>Program <code>ThermalConductivity</code>> used molecular dynamics to simulate the behavior of particles moving in a three-dimensional box interacting through a Lennard-Jones potential. 
The velocity Verlet algorithm and 
toroidal boundary conditions are used. </p>

<p>In the program the length of the system in the z-direction is three times longer than the 
other two directions to allow for a better estimate of a temperature
gradient in the z-direction. The system is divided into slabs in the z-direction.  The temperature gradient is 
created by an energy flux due to swapping the slowest moving particle in a &#8220;hot slab&#8221; with the fastest moving particle in 
the &#8220;cold slab.&#8221; The thermal conductivity is determined from the ratio of the energy flux to the temperature gradient.     </p>

<p>To begin the simulation we first equilibrate the system at a user specified temperature. Stopping the equilibration  starts 
the swapping, thus creating an energy flux and temperature gradient.</p>


<h2>Problem: Determining the thermal conductivity</h2>


<p>Program <code>ThermalConductivity</code> computes the thermal conductivity &kappa; for a system of particles interacting 
with a Lennard-Jones potential cut off at 3&sigma;.  The program uses the 
algorithm by M&uuml;ller-Plathe. The total number of particles is N = 3k<sup>3</sup>, 
where the number of slabs in the z direction is 3k. The default values are k = 10, T = 0.7, and &rho; = 0.849.
Run the program until the system reaches  equilibrium  at constant T. (The program uses velocity rescaling to bring
the system to the desired temperature.)
When the <code>Stop equilibration</code> button is pressed, velocity rescaling is stopped, and energy 
transfer from the slab at z = 0 to the middle slab is started. Press the <code>Reset Data</code> button several 
times to check that the simulation has reached a steady state. The temperature profiles in the left and 
right halves of the box are plotted separately to give you an idea of how well the averages have converged.

<ol type ="a">
<li> What is the estimated value of &kappa; for the default values of N, &rho;, and T?</li>

<li> How do you expect &kappa; to change with increasing T for fixed &rho; ?
Test your expectation by doubling the temperature.</li>

<li> How do you expect &kappa; to change with increasing &rho;  for fixed T? Test your expectation by 
increasing the density by 10%.</li>

<li> <sup>*</sup>Increase N while keeping the density and the temperature the same as in part (a) and determine the 
importance of finite size effects on the 
computed value of &kappa;.</li>
