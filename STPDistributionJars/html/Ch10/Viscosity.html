  <div style="position:absolute;left:30px;top:500px;">





  








<p>Program <code>Viscosity</code> simulates the behavior of particles moving in a three-dimensional box interacting through a Lennard-Jones potential. 


The program  uses the velocity Verlet algorithm and toroidal boundary conditions. </p>





<p>In this program the length of the system in the z-direction is three times longer than the 


other two directions to allow for a better estimate of the x-velocity


gradient in the z-direction. The system is divided into slabs in the z-direction.  The x-velocity gradient is 


created by a momentum flux due to swapping the smallest x-velocity in a &#8220;high momentum slab&#8221; with the largest x-velocity in 


the &#8220;low momentum slab.&#8221; The viscosity is determined from the ratio of the momentum flux to the x-velocity gradient.     </p>





<p>To begin the simulation we first equilibrate the system at a user specified temperature. We then  stop the 


equilibration, which starts 


the swapping of velocities, creating a momentum flux and x-velocity gradient. </p>





<h2>Problem: Simulation of the viscosity</h2>





<p>Program <code>Viscosity</code>  uses &eta; = -P<sub>xz</sub>/(&Delta;v<sub>x</sub>/&Delta;z)


to determine the viscosity for a system of particles interacting via the Lennard-Jones potential


with a cutoff equal to 3 &sigma;.  The number of particles is N = 3k<sup>3</sup>, 


where the number of slabs in the z direction is 3k. The default values are k = 10, T = 0.7, and &rho; = 0.849.


Run the program until the system reaches  equilibrium  at the desired constant value of T. 


(The program uses velocity rescaling.)


When the <code>Stop equilibration</code> button is pressed, the process of momentum transfer from slab at z = 0


to the middle slab is started. Press the <code>Reset Data</code> button several times to ensure that the system has 


reached a steady state. The mean x momentum in the left and right halves of the box are plotted separately 


so that you can determine how well they agree.





<ol type ="a">


<li> What is the value of the viscosity for the default values of N, &rho;, and T?</li>


<li> How do you expect &eta; to change with increasing T for fixed &rho;? Test your expectation 


using Program <code>Viscosity</code>  by doubling the temperature.</li>





<li> How do you expect &eta; to change with increasing &rho; for fixed T? Test your expectation 


using Program <code>Viscosity</code> by increasing the density by 10%.</li>





<li> <sup>*</sup>Increase N while keeping the density and the temperature the same as in part (a) 


and determine the importance of finite size effects on the 


computed value of &eta;.</li>
