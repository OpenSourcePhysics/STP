  <div style="position:absolute;left:30px;top:500px;">

  


<p>Program <tt>Viscosity</tt> simulates the behavior of particles moving in a three-dimensional box interacting through a Lennard-Jones potential. 
The program  uses the velocity Verlet algorithm to update the positions and velocities of the particles according to Newton's second law. 
Periodic boundary conditions are used. </p>

<p>In this program the length of the system in the z-direction is three times longer than the 
other two directions to allow for a better estimate of the x-velocity
gradient in the z-direction. The system is divided into slabs in the z-direction.  The x-velocity gradient is 
created by a momentum flux due to swapping the smallest x-velocity in a &#8220;high momentum slab&#8221; with the largest x-velocity in 
the &#8220;low momentum slab.&#8221; The viscosity is determined from the ratio of the momentum flux to the x-velocity gradient.     </p>

<p>To begin the simulation we first equilibrate the system at a user specified temperature. We then  stop the 
equilibration, which starts 
the swapping of velocities, creating a momentum flux and x-velocity gradient. </p>

<h2>Problem: Simulation of the viscosity</h2>

<p>Program <tt>Viscosity</tt>  uses &eta; = - P<sub>xz</sub>/(&Delta;v<sub>x</sub>/&Delta;z)
to determine the viscosity for a system of particles interacting via the Lennard-Jones potential
with a cutoff equal to 3 &sigma;.  The number of particles is N=3k<sup>3</sup>, 
where the number of slabs in the z direction is 3k. The default values are k = 10, T = 0.7, and &rho; = 0.849.
Run the program until the system reaches  equilibrium  at the desired constant value of T. 
(The program uses velocity rescaling.)
When the <tt>Stop equilibration</tt> button is pressed, the process of momentum transfer from slab at z = 0
to the middle slab is started. Press the <tt>Reset Data</tt> button several times to ensure that the system has 
reached a steady state. The mean x momentum in the left and right halves of the box are plotted separately 
so that you can determine how well they agree.

<ol type ="a">
<li> What is the value of the viscosity for the default values of N, &rho;, and T?</li>
<li> How do you expect &eta; to change with increasing T for fixed &rho;? Test your expectation 
using Program <tt>Viscosity</tt>  by doubling the temperature.</li>

<li> How do you expect &eta; to change with increasing &rho; for fixed T? Test your expectation 
using Program <tt>Viscosity</tt> by increasing the density by 10%.</li>

<li> <sup>*</sup>Increase N while keeping the density and the temperature the same as in part (a) 
and determine the importance of finite size effects on the 
computed value of &eta;.</li>
