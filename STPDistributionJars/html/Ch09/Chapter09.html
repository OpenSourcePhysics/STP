  <h2>Chapter 9: Critical Phenomena: Landau Theory and the Renormalization Group Method</h2>

  <p>Landau theory is a  mean-field theory approach to phase transitions. Although the theory does not usually provide 
  accurate values for critical exponents, it  provides a useful qualitative picture of phase transitions. 
  The renormalization 
  group method provides not just a calculation approach for determining the critical exponents, but also a conceptual
  understanding of phase transitions.     </p>
  
  <p>We will use the renormalization group to study the simplest statistical physics model, <i>percolation</i> as well as the Ising model.     </p>
