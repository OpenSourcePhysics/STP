  <h2>Chapter 6: Many-Particle Systems</h2>

  <p>We apply the techniques of statistical mechanics to many particle systems. 
  Our focus will be on systems where we can treat the particles as noninteracting. The first half of
  the chapter discusses classical and semiclassical systems, and the second half discusses systems where quantum 
  mechanics is essential. 
  
  <p>The key results for classical systems are the Maxwell velocity and speed distributions 
  and the equipartition theorem, 
  which are  applicable for gases, liquids, and solids.  </p>
  
 <p>Quantum systems that are discussed include blackbody radiation (considered as a collection of photons), the Debye model
 of solids (considered as quantized sound waves or normal modes), Fermi systems such as electrons in metals, neutron stars, 
 and white dwarfs, and  Bose gases which can condense into a single ground state at low enough temperatures. 
 To study these systems we  use the grand canonical ensemble to  treat the indistinguishability of the particles, and introduce 
 the concepts of single particle density of states and the 
 mean occupation of each single particle state (distribution function) at a temperature T and
 chemical potential &mu;.
