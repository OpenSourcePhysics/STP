<p>The steps in a random walk can take on discrete or continuous values. 
Program <code>RandomWalkContinuous</code> allows you to explore how continuous random walks can be described 
in   a similar way as walks with fixed steps as the number of steps   N &#8811; 1. </p>


<h2>Problem: Simulation of a random walk with variable
step length</h2>

<p>Use Program <code>RandomWalkContinuous</code> to simulate a random walk in one 
dimension with a variable step length. 

<ol type ="a">

<li> The step length is generated at random with a uniform probability between 0 and 1. 
Calculate the mean displacement and its variance for one step.</li>

<li>Compare your analytical results from part (a) to the results of your simulation for N = 1  (p = 1/2).</li>

<li> How does the variance of the displacement found in the simulation for N=16 depend on 
the variance of the displacement for N=1 that you calculated in part (a)?</li>

<li> Explore how the histogram changes with the bin width. What is a reasonable choice of the bin width for N = 100?
</li>
