<p>Program <code>CoinToss</code> models the repeated tossing of a single coin or the tossing of a large number of identical coins at the same time. 
The goal of this simulation is to see how the percentage of times that you obtain  heads fluctuates and to obtain some feel 
for how close you come to the expected average after N tosses of a single coin or the toss of N coins at one time.   </p>

<h2>Problem: Multiple tosses of a single coin</h2>

<p>Use Program <code>CoinToss</code>  to simulate
multiple tosses of a single coin. What is the correspondence
between this simulation of a coin being tossed many times and the
actual physical tossing of a coin? If the coin is &#8220;fair,&#8221; what
do you think the ratio of the number of heads to the total number of
tosses will be? Do you obtain this number after 100 tosses? 10,000
tosses? </p>
