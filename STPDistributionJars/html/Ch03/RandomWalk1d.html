<p>Program <code>RandomWalk1d</code> allows you to explore the properties of random walks in one dimension. Random walks are an example of a Bernoulli process for which there are two possible independent 
events (a step to the right or to the left). The distribution of walks in a particular direction is given by the <i>binomial distribution</i>. In addition, random walks are models of <i>diffusion</i>.    </p>

<h2>Problem: Monte Carlo simulation of a one-dimensional random walk</h2>

Program <code>RandomWalk1d</code> simulates a random walk in one dimension. 
A walker starts at the origin and takes N steps. At each step the walker goes to 
the right with probability p or to the left with probability q = 1 - p. Each step has the same unit 
length and is independent of the previous steps. 
Are some displacements more likely than others? 
We can simulate an N-step walk by the following pseudocode:
<br>do istep = 1, N
 <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;if (rnd <= p) then
 <br>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;x = x + 1
<br>  &nbsp; &nbsp;else
<br>    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;x = x - 1
<br>  &nbsp; &nbsp;end if
<br>end do


<p>The function <code>rnd</code> generates a  number between zero
and one with equal probability. The quantity
x is the net displacement after N steps assuming that the steps are of unit
length.

<p>We average over many walkers (trials), where each trial consists of a N step walk and 
construct a histogram for the number of times that the displacement x is found. 
The probability that the walker is a distance x from the origin after N steps is proportional to 
the corresponding value of the histogram. This procedure is called <i>Monte Carlo</i> sampling.


<ol type ="a">
<li> Is the value of x for one trial of any interest? Why do we have to average over many trials? </li> 

<li> Will we obtain the exact answer for the probability distribution by doing a Monte Carlo simulation? </li> 

<li> How does the histogram  change  for larger values of N. Assume p = 1/2 here and in the following. </li> 

<li> What is the most probable value of x for  N = 16 and N = 32?  Estimate the width of the 
distribution visually. How does the width change as a function of N? </li> 

<li> How does the histogram change, if at all, as the number of walkers increases for  N = 4? </li>
