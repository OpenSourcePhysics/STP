<p>Previously we used the demon algorithm as an ideal thermometer, where the demon was an extra degree of freedom that 
could exchange energy with the system. A plot of the log of the demon energy distribution ln P(E<sub>d</sub>) 
versus the demon energy
E<sub>d</sub> is a straight line with a slope equal to -1/kT. We now  also allow the demon to exchange particles with the system,
 so that a plot of  the log of the demon particle number distribution ln P(N<sub>d</sub>) versus the demon particle number
N<sub>d</sub> for a particular value of E<sub>d</sub> is a straight line with a slope equal to &mu;/kT.  </p>

<p> The program  simulates a simple model in one dimension where the particles have discrete values of momentum and position. A 
 single particle state is defined by
its location in a two-dimensional momentum-position phase space. To represent a dilute classical system only one 
particle per phase space point is allowed.  Attractive interactions between neighboring particles can be added and a hard core 
repulsion can be added to prevent more than one particle at the same position. 

<p> The goal of this simulation is to explore how &mu; depends on particle density and the effect of the interactions.

<h2>Problem: The chemical potential of a one-dimensional ideal gas</h2>

Program <code>ChemicalPotentialDemon</code>
implements this algorithm for the one-dimensional ideal gas and computes P(E<sub>d</sub>,N<sub>d</sub>), the probability 
that the demon has energy E<sub>d</sub> and N<sub>d</sub> particles.

<ol type ="a">

<li> Use the default
parameters N = 100, E = 200, and L = 100, where N is the total number of
particles, L is the
length of the box, and E is the maximum total energy. The program uses units such that 
&Delta; x &Delta; p = 1, and m = 1/2 so
that the kinetic energy of a particle is &epsilon; = p<sup>2</sup>. These choices
imply that the momentum and energy are integers. 
The N particles are initially
randomly placed on the sites of the phase space lattice with no more
than one particle on a site such that the total energy does not exceed E. The initial demon energy E<sub>d</sub> = 0 and
particle number N<sub>d</sub> = 0. Run the simulation and discuss the qualitative features of the positions of 
the particles in phase space. Do some  particles  have the same position? Run the simulation for different 
values of E, but the same values of the other parameters.
Where in phase space are most of the particles located?</li>

<li> Explain why the simulation in part (a) is identical to a simulation of an ideal gas in the semiclassical limit. 
Show that the chemical potential is given by

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&mu; = -T ln[(L/N)(&pi; T)<sup>1/2</sup>].&nbsp; &nbsp; (1)

(Remember that &Delta;x &Delta;p = 1.)</li>

<li> Use the same parameters as in part (a) and run for about 200 Monte Carlo steps per particle (mcs) to 
equilibrate the system. Then click <code>Zero Averages</code> and average over at least 1000 mcs. 
(The simulation will run faster if you increase the steps per display to 10 or 100.) 
After the simulation is stopped, click the <code>Plot Demon Distributions</code> button to display the demon energy and 
particle number distributions. The plot of ln P(E<sub>d</sub>, 
N<sub>d</sub> = 1) versus E<sub>d</sub> should be approximately linear for 
small E<sub>d</sub>.
Use the plots to estimate the values of T and &mu; and compare your Monte Carlo results with the exact result 
that you found in part (b).</li>

<li> How do you expect &mu; to change if you lower the particle density? Run the 
simulation for N = 50, E = 100, and L = 100 and compare the temperature and chemical potential 
obtained from the demon distributions with the results found in part (c). </li>
</ol>

<h2>Problem: The effects of interparticle interactions</h2>

What are the effects of including interactions between the particles in a dilute classical gas?
<ol type ="a">

<li> If the interaction has a hard core, no two particles can have the same position. 
How do you expect &mu; to change compared to the ideal gas?
Use Program <code>ChemicalPotentialDemon</code> and determine the effect of including a hard core on &mu;. 
For this comparison set L = 200 and N = 100. Why must L be much larger than N?</li>

<li> If we include an attractive interaction between particles that are nearest neighbors in position, 
the energy of the system will be lowered for some particle additions, thus giving the demon more energy.
How do you expect &mu; to change compared to the hard core system?</li>
