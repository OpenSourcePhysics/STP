<p>For a classical  many-particle system the chemical potential &mu; can be divided into two parts, one  
 equal to the chemical potential of an ideal gas, 
and the other associated with 
interactions of the particles, which is denoated as &mu;<sub>excess</sub>. We can compute &mu;<sub>excess</sub> in a Monte Carlo 
simulation by using the Widom insertion method such that
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&mu;<sub>excess</sub> = -kT &lt; e<sup>-&beta; &Delta;U </sup>&gt;,&nbsp; &nbsp; (1)
<p>where &Delta;U is the change in the potential energy of the system if an imaginary particle is
 placed at a random position in the system. The average is formed by doing this 
 imaginary insertion many times throughout the simulation.   </p>

<p> The program does a standard  Metropolis simulation of particles interacting through the Lennard-Jones potential, 
and computes &mu;<sub>excess</sub>. </p>

<h2>Problem: The excess chemical potential of a Lennard-Jones fluid</h2>
Program <code>ChemicalPotentialMC</code> implements the Widom insertion method to estimate the chemical potential 
for a system of particles interacting with the Lennard-Jones potential. 
Determine the density dependence of the excess chemical potential of a Lennard-Jones fluid. 
Are your results for &mu;<sub>excess</sub> consistent with qualitative arguments given in the text?</p>
