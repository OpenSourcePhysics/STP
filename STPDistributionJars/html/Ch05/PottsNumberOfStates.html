  <div style="position:absolute;left:30px;top:500px;">

  


<p>Program <tt>PottsNumberOfStates</tt> uses the Wang-Landau Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the 
number of microstates &Omega;(E) for each value of E in the q-state 2d Potts model on a square lattice. In the Potts model 
there are q possible states for each spin and the interaction energy between any pair of neighboring spins is -J 
if the spins have the same value and is 0 otherwise. The 2-state Potts model is equivalent to the Ising model. 
 Once &Omega;(E)  is known  averages 
such as the mean energy can be found at any temperature using
<br>
&lt;E&gt; = &Sigma;<sub>E</sub> EP(E) = &Sigma;<sub>E</sub> E&Omega;(E)e<sup>-E/kT</sup> / &Sigma;<sub>E</sub>&Omega;(E)e<sup>-E/kT</sup>.    </p>

<p> The program also calculates the specific heat as a function of temperature from a single simulation. From the
energy distribution ln P(E) we obtain evidence for whether the phase transition is continuous or discontinuous. 
The nature of the transition depends on q. </p>

<h2>Problem: Application of Wang-Landau algorithm to the Potts model</h2>
<ol type ="a">

<li>
What is the relation of the q = 2 Potts model to the usual Ising model? In particular, 
what is the relation of the interaction energy K defined in the Potts model and the 
interaction energy J defined in the Ising model? </li>

<li>
Program <tt>PottsNumberOfStates</tt> implements the Wang-Landau algorithm
 for the Potts model on a square lattice. Run the program for L = 16 and various values of q and 
 verify that the peak in the specific heat occurs near the known exact value of the transition temperature 
 given by T<sub>c</sub> = (ln(1 + q<sup>1/2</sup>))<sup>-1</sup>. You will need more than 100,000 Monte Carlo steps to obtain 
 reliable data.</li>

<li>
Choose q = 2 and q=3 and observe the energy distribution P(E) = &Omega;(E) e<sup>-&beta;E</sup> at T = T<sub>c</sub>. 
Do you see one peak or two?</li>

<li>
Choose q = 10 and observe the energy distribution P(E) at T = T<sub>c</sub>. You should notice 
two peaks in this distribution. Discuss why the occurrence of two peaks is appropriate 
for a discontinuous transition.
