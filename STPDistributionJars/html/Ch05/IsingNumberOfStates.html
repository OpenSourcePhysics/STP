<p>Program <code>IsingNumberOfStates</code> uses the Wang-Landau Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the 
number of microstates &Omega;(E) for each value of E of the 2d Ising model on a square lattice. Once &Omega;(E) is 
known from one simulation  averages 
such as the mean energy can be found at any temperature using
<br>
&lt;E&gt; = &Sigma;<sub>E</sub> EP(E) = &Sigma;<sub>E</sub> E&Omega;(E)e<sup>-E/kT</sup> / &Sigma;<sub>E</sub>&Omega;(E)e<sup>-E/kT</sup>.   
<br>The program also calculates the specific heat as a function of temperature from a single simulation.  </p>

Calculate the exact values of &Omega;(E) for the 2 x 2 Ising model. Run the simulation for L = 2 and
 verify that the computed number of states is close to your exact answer.</li>

<li>
Choose larger values of L, for example, L = 16, and describe the qualitative energy dependence of &Omega;(E).</li>

<li>
