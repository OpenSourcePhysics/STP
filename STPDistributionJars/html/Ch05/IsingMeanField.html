<p>The results of   mean-field theory require the numerical solution of the self-consistent equation
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;m = tanh [(Jqm + H)/kT].  &nbsp; &nbsp; (1)
<p>To understand the solutions it is helpful to also calculate the Helmholtz function (per spin)
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;f = -kT ln[2cosh[(Jqm + H)/kT]]. &nbsp; &nbsp; (2)    </p>

<p> The program plots m versus m and tanh[(Jqm + H)/kT] versus m in one window and
f versus m in another window. From the first window we can pick out the possible equilibrium 
values of m. From the minima of f(m) 
we can determine the actual equilibrium value(s) of m. Units are chosen so that k = 1 and J = 1. </p>


<h2>Problem: Numerical solutions of  mean field equations</h2>

Program <code>IsingMeanField</code> uses Newton's method to find the zeros of the 
function g(m) = m - tanh &beta;(Jqm + H).

<ol type ="a">

<li>
Set H = 0 and q = 4 and confirm the mean-field approximation for the critical 
temperature T<sub>c</sub> of the Ising model on a square lattice. Start with kT/Jq = 10 and 
then proceed to lower temperatures. The equilibrium value of m is the solution with the 
lowest value of the Helmholtz function.</li>

<li> Plot the temperature dependence of m for T &lt; T<sub>c</sub>.</li>

<li>
Determine m(T) for the one-dimensional Ising model (q = 2) and
H = 0 and H = 1. Compare your values for m(T) with the exact solution in one
dimension.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Problem: Minima of the Helmholtz function</h2>
It can be shown that  f(m)  near the critical point  can be written as


<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;f(m) = a + b(1-&beta;q J)m<sup>2</sup> + cm<sup>4</sup>,&nbsp; &nbsp; (3)
<br>where a, b, and c are positive.

<ol type ="a">

<li>
Show that the minimum value of f for T &gt;T<sub>c</sub>  is at m = 0, and that 
m = &plusmn; m<sub>0</sub> corresponds to a 
lower value of f for T &lt; T<sub>c</sub>.</li>

<li>
Use Program <code>IsingMeanField</code> to plot f(m) as a function 
of m for T&gt;T<sub>c</sub>. For what value of m does f(m) have a minimum? </li>

<li>
Plot f(m) for T = 1. Where are the minima of f(m)? Do they have the same depth? If so, what is the 
meaning of this result?</li>

<li>
If H is nonzero but small, there is an additional term -mH in Eq. (3).
Choose T = 1 and H = 0.5. Do the two minima have the same depth? The global minimum of f 
corresponds to the stable phase. If we quickly &#8220;flip&#8221; the field and let H go to -0.5, 
the minimum at m &asymp; 1 will become a local minimum. The system will remain in this 
local minimum for some time before it switches to the global minimum. </li>
