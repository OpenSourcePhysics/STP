<p>Program <code>Ising1d</code>  simulates N Ising  spins  on a ring, although we visualize the ring as a straight line. 
The Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm is used.  The goal of this simulation is to explore the properties of the 1d Ising model and compare with analytical results. 
It is also important  to understand why there is no phase transition for  temperature T > 0. </p>

<h2>Problem: Computer simulation of the Ising chain</h2>

Use Program <code>Ising1d</code> to simulate the
one-dimensional Ising model. It is convenient to measure the temperature in 
units such that J/k = 1. For example, a temperature of T = 2 means that T = 2J/k. The &#8220;time&#8221; is 
measured in terms of Monte Carlo steps per spin (mcs), where in one Monte Carlo step per spin, N 
spins are chosen at random for trial changes. (On the average each spin will be chosen equally, 
but during any finite interval, some spins might be chosen more than others.)  Choose N &ge; 200 and H = 0.

<li> Visually estimate the mean size of the domains (regions of parallel spins) at T = 1.0 and T = 0.5. 
By how much does the mean size of the domains increase when T is decreased? 
Compare your estimates with the correlation length given by 
&xi; =-1/ln(tanh &beta;J).

What is the qualitative temperature dependence of the mean domain size?</li>

<li> Why does the Metropolis algorithm become inefficient at low temperatures?</li>
