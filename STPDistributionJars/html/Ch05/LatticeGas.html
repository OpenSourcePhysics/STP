<p>The Ising model is very versatile. In addition to being a model of magnetic systems, it can also be a model of a fluid. 
The <i>lattice gas</i>  version of the Ising model replaces the spins s<sub>i</sub> = &plusmn; 1 with 
occupation numbers n<sub>i</sub> = 0 or 1. 
If there are particles on both neighboring sites, there is an attractive interaction -u<sub>0</sub>;
otherwise, the interaction energy is 0. A hard core repulsion typical of fluid particles is maintained by the limitation that 
n<sub>i</sub> &le; 1.     </p>

<p> In the lattice gas Monte Carlo simulation we exchange the values of n<sub>i</sub> for neighboring sites rather 
than flipping spins.
Thus, the number of particles is conserved, and the chemical potential plays a role analogous the magnetic field. 
The program also includes a gravitational field which causes particles to sink toward the bottom. In addition to exploring 
the phase transition in this model, the program can be used to explore quenches from high to low temperatures.   </p>

<h2>Problem: Simulation of the lattice gas</h2>

<ol type ="a">

<li>
What is the value of the critical temperature T<sub>c</sub> for the lattice gas in two dimensions in units of u<sub>0</sub>/k?</li>

<li>
Program <tt>LatticeGas</tt> simulates the lattice gas on a square lattice of linear dimension L. 
The initial state has all the particles at the bottom of the simulation cell. Choose L=32 and 
set the gravitational field equal to zero. Do a simulation at T= 0.4 with N= 600 particles. 
After a few Monte Carlo steps you should see the bottom region of particles (blue sites) develop a 
few small holes or bubbles and the unoccupied region contain a few isolated particles or small clusters of 
particles. This system represents a liquid (the predominately blue region) in equilibrium with its 
vapor (the mostly yellow region). Record the energy. To speed up the simulation set <tt>steps per display</tt>
 equal to 100.</li>

<li>
Increase the temperature in steps of 0.05 until T = 0.7. At each value of T run for at least 10,000 mcs to 
reach equilibrium and then press the <tt>Zero Averages</tt> button. Run for at least 20,000 mcs before recording 
your estimate of the energy. Describe the visual appearance of the positions of the particle and empty sites at 
each temperature. At what temperature does the one large liquid region break up into many pieces, such that 
there is no longer a sharp distinction between the liquid and vapor region? At this temperature there is a 
single fluid phase. Is there any evidence from your estimates of the energy that a transition from a two-phase 
to a one-phase system has occurred? </li>


<li>
Repeat part (b) with N=512. In this case the system will pass through a critical point. 
The change from a one-phase to a two-phase system occurs continuously in the thermodynamic limit. 
Can you detect this change or does the system look similar to the case in part (b)? </li>

<li>
If we include a gravitational field, the program removes the periodic boundary conditions in the 
vertical direction, and thus sites in the top and bottom rows have three neighbors instead of four. 
The gravitational field should help define the liquid and gas regions. Choose g =0.01 and repeat the 
above simulations. Describe the differences you see.</li>

<li>
Simulate a lattice gas of N = 2048 particles on a L=64 x 64 lattice at T = 2.0 with no 
gravitational field for 5000 mcs. Then change the temperature to T = 0.2. This process is called 
a (temperature) quench, and the resulting behavior is called <i>spinodal decomposition</i>. 
The domains grow very slowly as a function of time. Discuss why it is 
difficult for the system to reach its equilibrium state for which there is one domain of mostly 
occupied sites in equilibrium with one domain of mostly unoccupied sites.</li>
