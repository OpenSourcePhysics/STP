<p>Approximation techniques are used to study the effect of inter-particle interactions in  gases. A
 common technique is the virial density expansion. The first-order expansion for the ideal gas is given by
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; PV/NkT = 1 + &rho; B<sub>2</sub>(T), &nbsp; &nbsp;  (1)
<br>where the second virial coefficient is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;B<sub>2</sub>(T) = 2&pi; &int; [1 - e<sup>u(r)/kT</sup>] r<sup>2</sup> dr .&nbsp; &nbsp; (2)
<br>The integral runs from 0 to &infin; and u(r) is a spherically symmetric inter-particle potential. 

<p>Program <code>SecondVirialCoefficient</code> computes B<sub>2</sub>(T) for the Lennard-Jones potential. </p> 

<h2>Problem: Temperature dependence of B<sub>2</sub></h2>

<ol type ="a">
<li> A potential that captures some of the properties of the Lennard-Jones potential is the 
square well potential which is defined as

<p>&nbsp;u(r) = &infin; &nbsp; (r &lt; &sigma;), 
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&epsilon; &nbsp; (&sigma; &lt; r &lt; &lambda;&sigma;),
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 &nbsp; (r &gt; &lambda;&sigma;),  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (3)
<br>where &sigma; is the diameter of the hard core, &lambda;&sigma; is the range of the attractive well, 
and &epsilon; is the well depth. Show that for this potential the Mayer function f(r) is 
given by 
<p>&nbsp;f(r) = -1 &nbsp; (r &lt; &sigma;), 
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;g &nbsp; (&sigma; &lt; r &lt; &lambda;&sigma;),
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 &nbsp; (r &gt; &lambda;&sigma;),  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(4)
<br>and
<br>B<sub>2</sub>(T) = (2&pi;&sigma;<sup>3</sup>/3)[1 - (&lambda;<sup>3</sup> - 1)g].&nbsp; &nbsp; (5)
<br>and g = e<sup>&beta;&epsilon;</sup> - 1.

<li>Plot the temperature dependence of B<sub>2</sub>(T) as given by Eq. (2) and compare it to the 
approximate temperature dependence given by B<sub>2</sub> = b - a/kT.</li>

<li> Program <code>SecondVirialCoefficient</code>  evaluates the integral over r in Eq. (2)
numerically to determine the temperature dependence of B<sub>2</sub> for the Lennard-Jones potential. 
 Compare the numerical results for the Lennard-Jones potential with the approximate 
 result B<sub>2</sub> = b - a/kT. At what temperature does B<sub>2</sub> vanish? How does this 
 temperature compare with that predicted by B<sub>2</sub> = b - a/kT = 0? </li>
