  <h2>Chapter 2: Thermodynamic Concepts and Processes</h2>

  <p>This chapter discusses how we can relate different properties of materials to 
  each other and   how these properties change under certain kinds of processes. 
  The discussion is based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The
  first law is a statement of conservation of energy with energy changes  divided into two types:
  work and heating or cooling. The second law states that the we need a new quantity, entropy, such that 
  for an isolated system the entropy never decreases no matter what happens inside the system. When the system
  comes to equilibrium, the entropy stops changing. From this idea we can  
  predict why energy goes from a hotter object to a cooler object.
   
   </p>
 <p>There are no problems in this chapter that use numerical techniques or simulations, because the strength of thermodynamics 
 is its ability to relate properties of materials without knowing the microscopic laws underlying the macroscopic behavior 
 of those materials.  A concise stand alone introduction to thermodynamic thinking is given in Chapter 2 of 
 <i>Statistical and Thermal Physics: With Computer Applications</i>, 2nd ed., 
    Harvey Gould and Jan Tobochnik, Princeton University Press (2021).  </p>
