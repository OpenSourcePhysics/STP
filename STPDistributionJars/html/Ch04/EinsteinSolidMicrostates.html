<p>The Einsein model consists of N oscillators and E packets of energy 
which can be distributed among the oscillators in &Omega; ways, where
<p>&Omega; = (E+N-1)!/[E! (N-1)!].&nbsp; &nbsp; (1)

<p>Each way is  a  <i>microstate</i>. </p>

<p>Program <code>EinsteinSolidMicrostates</code> considers two systems    which can share energy; the number of
oscillators in each system is fixed. The  idea is to explore the probability of various distributions
of energy between the two systems.</p>

<h2>Problem: Two Einstein solids in thermal contact</h2>

Consider two Einstein solids
with N<sub>A</sub> = 4 and
E<sub>A</sub> = 10 and N<sub>B</sub> = 4 and E<sub>B</sub> = 2. The two subsystems are
thermally isolated from one another and from their surroundings. Verify that the number of microstates accessible to subsystem A is 286 and the number of microstates accessible to subsystem B is 10. What is the initial number of accessible
microstates for the composite system?

Program <code>EinsteinSolidMicrostates</code> determines the number
of accessible microstates of an Einstein solid using
Eq. (1) and will help you answer the following questions.

<ol type ="a">

<li> The internal
constraint is removed so that the two subsystems may exchange energy. Determine
the probability
P<sub>A</sub>(E<sub>A</sub>) that system
A has energy
E<sub>A</sub>. Plot
P<sub>A</sub> versus E<sub>A</sub> and discuss its qualitative energy dependence.

<li> What is the probability that energy is transferred from system A to system B and from 
system B to system A? 
Which system would you identify as the colder system? </li>

<li> Determine the mean energy E&#772;<sub>A</sub>, the most probable energy  E<sub>A,max</sub>, the 
standard deviations &#963;<sub>A</sub> and &#963;<sub>B</sub>, and the 
relative fluctuations &#963;<sub>A</sub>/E&#772;<sub>A</sub>. </li>


<li> What is the number of accessible microstates of the
composite system after the internal constraint has been
relaxed? What is the change in S of the 
system (choose units such that k = 1)?</li>

<li> The
quantity S of the composite system when each subsystem is in its most
probable macrostate is ln &Omega;<sub>A</sub>(E<sub>A,max</sub>)
&Omega;<sub>B</sub>(E<sub>tot</sub> - E<sub>A,max</sub>). Compare the value of this contribution to the value of 
S<sub>tot</sub> = ln &#931; &Omega;<sub>A</sub>(E<sub>A</sub>)
&Omega;<sub>B</sub>(E<sub>tot</sub>- E<sub>A</sub>), where the sum is over E<sub>A</sub>.

<li> Consider
successively larger systems and describe the qualitative behavior of the various quantities.</li>
