<p>Program <code>MCEinsteinSolid</code> simulates the Einstein solid using the Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm, 
which simulates systems  at  constant temperature. An oscillator is chosen at random and one unit of energy is 
either added or taken from the oscillator. If the change decreases the energy of the system,  the change is accepted. 
If it increases the energy, a random number r between 0 and 1 is computed and 
compared to p = e<sup>-&#916;E/kT</sup>, where &#916;E is the change in energy of the system. If 
p &ge; r, the change is accepted; otherwise it is rejected. This algorithm leads to a Boltzmann distribution for the microstates of the system.     </p>

<p> The goal of this simulation is to show how the Metropolis algorithm works to simulate a system in the 
canonical ensemble. </p>


<h2>Problem: Simulation of the Einstein solid in
equilibrium with a reservoir</h2>

Program <code>MCEinsteinSolid</code>  implements the Metropolis algorithm for an Einstein solid of N
particles at a temperature T. (As usual, we choose units such
that the Boltzmann constant k = 1.)

<ol type ="a">

<li> Choose
N=20 and &beta; = 1/kT = 1. Does the energy of the system eventually reach a
well-defined average? If so, determine &lt;E&gt;(T).</li> 

<li> Compare your results to the analytical results found in Problem 4.26 in the text.  </li>
