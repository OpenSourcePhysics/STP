<p>For a quantum particle in d dimensions (or equivalently d particles in one dimension) each  microstate 
is represented by a point labeled by n<sub>1</sub>,n<sub>2</sub>,... n<sub>d</sub>, where the n<sub>i</sub> 
can each take on any positive integer.  </p>

<p> This program allows us to calculate finite size effects for the number of microstates below a certain energy E 
by comparing the actual count with the approximate count given in 1d by &Gamma;<sub>1</sub> = R, 
in 2d by &Gamma;<sub>2</sub> = &pi; R<sup>2</sup>/4 and in 3d by
&Gamma;<sub>3</sub> = &pi; R<sup>3</sup>/6,  where E = h<sup>2</sup>R<sup>2</sup>/8mL<sup>2</sup>, 
L is the length of the infinite well containing the particles, m is the mass 
of the particle, and h is the Planck constant.  </p>

<h2>Problem: Finite-size effects in two dimensions</h2>

&Gamma;(E) = (1/4)&pi; R<sup>2</sup> = &pi; (L<sup>2</sup>/h<sup>2</sup>)(2mE).&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1)

<p>Equation (1) for &Gamma;(E) is valid only
for large E because the area of a quadrant of a circle
overestimates the number of lattice points n<sub>x</sub>,n<sub>y</sub> inside a circle
of radius R. Use  Program <code>CountingStates</code> to explore how well the relation &Gamma; = &pi;R<sup>2</sup>/4
approximates the actual number of microstates. The program computes the number of nonzero, positive integers that satisfy
the condition (n<sub>x</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (n<sub>y</sub>)<sup>2</sup> &le; R<sup>2</sup>.
What is the minimum value of R for which the difference between
the asymptotic relation and the exact number is less than 1%?
