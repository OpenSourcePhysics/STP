  <h2>Statistical and Thermal Physics Programs</h2>

  <p>This collection includes all the Java programs used in the text <i>Statistical and Thermal Physics: With Computer Applications</i>, 2nd ed., 
    Harvey Gould and Jan Tobochnik, Princeton University Press (2021). The Java programs use the Open Source Physics (OSP)
    library created by Wolfgang Christian and supported by many other collaborators. The source code for the Java programs and OSP can be found on 
     <a href="https://www.github.com/OpenSourcePhysics/">Github</a>.
       </p>

  <h3>Program Resources and Organization</h3>
   <ol>

<li> Each STP Javascript program can be <a href="https://www.compadre.org/stpbook">run</a> in a browser. </li>

    <li>Source code for all Java and Python versions of the programs, and the latest version of this jar file can be 
    found on <a href="https://www.compadre.org/osp/items/detail.cfm?ID=7308">ComPADRE</a>.
     </li>
 
</ol>

<p>We thank Wolfgang Christian for his assistance in creating this jar file. The Javascript programs on ComPADRE were
      converted from Java by Wolfgang Christian and Robert Hanson using the SwingJS system developed at St. Olaf College. </p>
