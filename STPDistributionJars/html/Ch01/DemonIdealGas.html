  <div style="position:absolute;left:30px;top:500px;">

  


<p>Program <code>DemonIdealGas</code> models an ideal thermometer called the <i>demon</i>. The demon is in thermal equilibrium 
with the system of interest such as an ideal gas. The energy of the demon is its only property. The demon randomly visits a particle in the system and attempts to change its velocity. If the change decreases 
the energy,
 the change is accepted and the system's lost energy goes to the demon. If the velocity change increases the system's energy, 
 the change is accepted only
if the demon has enough energy to give to cover the increase in energy of the system.  </p>

<p> The goal of the simulation is to explore how the demon's mean energy 
and probability distribution are related to the temperature. </p>

<h2>Problem: The demon and the ideal gas</h2>

Program  <code> DemonIdealGas</code> simulates a demon that
exchanges energy with an ideal gas of  N  particles in  d 
spatial dimensions. Because the particles do not interact, the only
coordinate of interest is the velocity of the particles.
The demon chooses a particle at random and changes each component of its
velocity by an amount chosen at
random between
 -&Delta;  and  +&Delta;.
For simplicity, we set the initial demon energy  E<sub>d</sub>=0  and the initial velocity of each
particle equal to  +v<sub>0</sub> in the x-direction, where  v<sub>0</sub> =
(2E<sub>0</sub>/mN)<sup>1/2</sup>.  E<sub>0</sub>  is the desired total energy of the system, and  m  is the mass of
the particles. We choose units such
that  m=1, and the energy and momentum are dimensionless.

<ol type ="a">
<li> Run the simulation using the default parameters  N = 40,  E = 40, and  d = 3. Does the 
average energy of the demon approach a well-defined value after a sufficient number of energy exchanges 
with the system? (One time unit is equal to  N  trial changes.)</li>

<li> What is the average energy of the demon, and  and  
the average energy of the system per particle? Compare these two  values.</li>

<li>  Fix  N = 40  and double the total energy of the system. (Remember that  E_d = 0  initially.) 
Compare the average values of   E<sub>d</sub>  and  E/N. 
Consider other values of  N &#8804; 40  and  E  and determine the relation between the averages of  
E<sub>d</sub>  and  E/N. (Because there are finite-size effects
that are order  1/N, it is desirable to consider  N &#8811; 1. The trade-off is 
that the simulation  takes longer to run.)</li>

<li>  You have probably learned in other courses that the average energy 
of an ideal gas in three dimensions is equal to  E = (3/2)NkT, where  T  is 
the temperature of the gas, N  is the number of particles, and  k  is a constant. Our choice 
of dimensionless variables 
 implies that we have chosen units such that  k = 1.  Use this relation  for  E&#772;  to 
 determine the temperature of the ideal gas in parts parts (b) and (c). 
 Is  the average of E<sub>d</sub>  proportional to the temperature of the gas?</li>

<li>  Suppose that the energy momentum relation of the particles
is not  &epsilon; = p<sup>2</sup>/2m , but is  &epsilon; = cp , where  c  is a
constant (which we take to be 1). Consider various values of  N  and  E  as you did in part (c). 
Is the dependence of the average of   E<sub>d</sub>  on  the average of E/N  the same as you found in 
 part (c)?  </li>

<li> *After the demon and the system have reached equilibrium, we can
compute the histogram  H(E<sub>d</sub>)&Delta; E<sub>d</sub>, the number of times that the demon has energy between  E<sub>d</sub>  
and  E<sub>d</sub> + &Delta; E<sub>d</sub>. The bin width  &Delta; E<sub>d</sub>  is chosen by the program. 
The histogram is proportional to the probability  p(E<sub>d</sub>)&Delta; E  that
the demon has energy between  E<sub>d</sub>  and  E<sub>d</sub> + &Delta E;. What do you think is 
the dependence of  p(E<sub>d</sub>)  on  E<sub>d</sub>? Is the demon more likely to have zero or nonzero energy?</li>

<li> *Verify the exponential form,  p(E<sub>d</sub>)=A exp(-&beta; E<sub>d</sub>), where  A  and  &beta;
  are parameters. 
How does the value of  1/&beta;  compare to the value of  the average of E<sub>d</sub> ? We will find that the 
exponential form of  p(E<sub>d</sub>)  is universal, that is, independent of the system with which the demon exchanges 
energy, and that  1/&beta;  is proportional to the temperature of the system.</li>

<li> Discuss why the demon is an ideal thermometer.</li>
