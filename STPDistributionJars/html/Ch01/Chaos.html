<p>Program <code>Chaos</code> simulates 11 particles initially moving with the same velocity such that the net force on each particle is zero.
The particles interact through the Lennard-Jones potential. Perturb the system  slightly and see what happens. The velocities 
can also be reversed to see to what extent the system is reversible.  </p>

<p> The goal of this simulation is to explore how a small 
perturbation changes a special initial state to one that we would expect to see in thermal equilibrium. 
The idea of chaos or sensitivity to initial conditions helps us understand irreversibility and why a system of particles reaches equilibrium.    </p>


<h2>Problem: Irreversibility</h2>


Program <code>Chaos</code>
simulates a system of
 N = 11  particles with a special initial condition.

<ol type ="a">

<li> Perturb the
velocity of particle 6 and discuss the qualitative results about chaos and irreversibility.</li> 

<li> Stop the simulation at a time
 t  after the perturbation and reverse all the velocities. Confirm that if  t  is
sufficiently short, the particles will return approximately to
their initial state. What is the maximum value of  t  that 
allows the particles to return to their initial positions if  t  is
replaced by  -t  (all velocities reversed)?</li> 
</ol>
