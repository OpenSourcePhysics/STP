  <h1 id="myTitle" style="position:fixed;">Program LennardJonesMD</h1>


  <div style="position:absolute;left:30px;top:500px;">

  


<p>Program <tt>LennardJonesMD</tt> simulates the behavior of particles moving in a two-dimensional box interacting through the Lennard-Jones potential. 
The velocities and positions evolve according to the numerical solution of the 
differential equations in Newton's second law. The velocity Verlet algorithm is used to update the positions and velocities of the particles. 
Toroidal boundary conditions are used so that particles that leave the box enter on the other side, much like many video games. </p>

<p>One goal of this simulation is to explore how the same inter-particle potential 
can lead to different macroscopic behavior such as gas, liquid, and solid phases. 
Other information that can be obtained includes the velocity distribution function, the pair distribution function g(r), which provides
information about the spatial structure of the system, and the diffusion of a tagged particle.   </p>

<h2>Problem: Different phases</h2>


<ol type ="a">

<li> Program <tt>LennardJonesMD</tt> simulates an
isolated system of
N particles interacting via the Lennard-Jones potential. Choose
N = 144 and
L = 18 so that the density
&#961; = N/L<sup>2</sup> &#8776; 0.44. The initial positions are
chosen at random except that no two particles are allowed to be
closer than the length
&#963;. Run the simulation and satisfy yourself that this choice
of density and resultant total energy corresponds to a gas. What are your
criteria?</li>

<li> Slowly lower the total energy of the system. (The total energy is
lowered by rescaling the velocities of the particles.) If you are patient,
you will be able to observe &#8220;liquidlike&#8221; regions. How are they different
from &#8220;gaslike&#8221; regions?</li>

<li> If you decrease the total energy further, you will observe the
system in a state roughly corresponding to a solid. What are your
criteria for a solid? Explain why the solid that we obtain in this
way will not be a perfect crystalline solid.</li>


<li> Describe the motion of  individual particles in the gas,
liquid, and solid phases.</li>

<li> Speculate why a system of particles interacting via the
Lennard-Jones potential can exist in
different phases. Is it necessary for the potential to have an
attractive part for the system to have a liquid phase? Is the
attractive part necessary for there to be a solid phase? Describe
a simulation that would help you answer this question.</li>
