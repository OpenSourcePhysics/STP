<p>The XY model (sometimes called the planar model) consists of spins on a  lattice where each spin 
can take on any angle $\theta_i$ between $0$ and $2\pi$. The energy is given by
$$E = -J \sum_{\lt ij \gt} \cos{(\theta_i - \theta_j)},$$
where $J$ is the interaction energy that sets the scale for the energy. It has been shown that the magnetization 
 vanishs for all nonzero temperatures $T$, and thus it was thought that there was no phase transition. However,
Kosterlitz and Thouless showed that there is a phase transition, $T_{\rm KT}$ such that below $T_{\rm KT}$ the spin-spin correlation
function falls off as a power law and above $T_{\rm KT}$ this correlation falls off exponentially. The phase transition
is caused by the unbinding of pairs of vortices, which are an example of topological defects.   </p>

<p> The  program simulates the XY model, calculates various thermodynamic quantities, and shows the location of the vortices.  </p>
