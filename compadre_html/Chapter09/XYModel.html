<p>The XY model (sometimes called the planar model) consists of spins on a  lattice where each spin 
can take on any angle $\theta_i$ between $0$ and $2\pi$. The energy is given by
$$E = -J \sum_{\lt ij \gt} \cos{(\theta_i - \theta_j)},$$
where $J$ is the interaction energy that sets the scale for the energy. It has been shown that the magnetization 
 vanishs for all nonzero temperatures $T$, and thus it was thought that there was no phase transition. However,
Kosterlitz and Thouless showed that there is a phase transition, $T_{\rm KT}$ such that below $T_{\rm KT}$ the spin-spin correlation
function falls off as a power law and above $T_{\rm KT}$ this correlation falls off exponentially. The phase transition
is caused by the unbinding of pairs of vortices, which are an example of topological defects.   </p>

<p> The  program simulates the XY model, calculates various thermodynamic quantities, and shows the location of the vortices.  </p>

<b>Problem: Simulations of the two-dimensional $XY$ (planar) model</b>

<p>In this model the spins are located on a $d$-dimensional lattice, but are restricted to point in any 
direction in the plane. The interaction between two nearest neighbor spins is 
given by $-J {\bf s}_1 \cdot {\bf s}_2$, where ${\bf s}_1$ and ${\bf s}_2$ are two unit spin vectors.</p>

<p>One of the interesting features of the $XY$ model in two dimensions
is that the mean magnetization $\langle m\rangle = 0$ for all nonzero temperatures, but there is a phase 
transition at a nonzero temperature $T_{\rm KT}$ known as the 
 Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. (J. Michael Kosterlitz and David J. Thouless received the 2016 Nobel Prize in 
 Physics for discovering and explaining this phase transition, which led to finding similar phase transitions 
 in many other systems and the recognition of the importance of topological defects such as the vortices 
 found in the planar model. F. Duncan M. Haldane shared the prize that year for related work.) 
 For $T \leq T_{\rm KT}$ the spin-spin correlation $C(r)$ decreases as a power law; for $T > T_{\rm KT}$, $C(r)$ 
 decreases exponentially. The power law decay of $C(r)$ for $T \leq T_{\rm KT}$ implies that every 
 temperature below $T_{\rm KT}$ acts as a critical point.</p>

<p>Program <tt>XYModel</tt> uses the Metropolis algorithm  to simulate the $XY$ model in two dimensions. 
In this case a spin is chosen at random and rotated by a random angle up to a maximum value $\delta$.

<ol type ="a">
<li> Rewrite the interaction $-J {\bf s}_i \cdot {\bf s}_j$ between nearest neighbor spins $i$ and $j$ 
in a simpler form by substituting $s_{i,x} = \cos\theta_i$ and $s_{i,y} = \sin \theta_i$, where the 
phase $\theta_i$ is measured from the horizontal axis in the counter-clockwise direction. Show that the result is
$-J \cos(\theta_i - \theta_j)$.</li>

<li> An interesting feature of the $XY$ model is the existence of vortices and antivortices. 
A vortex is a region of the lattice where the spins rotate by at least $2\pi$ as you trace a 
closed path. Run the simulation with the default parameters and observe the locations of the vortices. 
Follow the arrows as they turn around a vortex. A vortex is indicated by a square box. What is the 
difference between a positive (blue) and negative (yellow) vortex? Does a vortex ever appear isolated? 
Count the number of positive vortices and negative vortices. Is the number the same at all times?</li>

<li> Click the <tt>New</tt> button, change the temperature to 0.2, set
the initial configuration to random, and run the simulation. You should see quenched-in vortices 
which don't change with time. Are there an equal number of positive and negative vortices? 
Are there isolated vortices whose centers are more than a lattice spacing apart?</li>

<li> Click the <tt>New</tt> button and set the initial configuration to
ordered and the temperature to 0.2. Also set steps per display to 100
so that the simulation will run much faster. Run the simulation for
at least $1000\,$mcs to equilibrate and $10,\kern1pt000\,$mcs to collect data,
and record your estimates of the energy, specific heat, vorticity, and the
susceptibility. Repeat for temperatures from 0.3 to 1.5 in steps of
0.1. Plot the energy and specific heat versus the temperature. (The
susceptibility diverges for all temperatures below the transition,
which occurs near $T=0.9$. The location of the specific heat peak is
different from the transition temperature. The program computes
$x=(1/NT^2)\langle M^2\rangle$ instead of the usual expression, because
$\langle M\rangle=0$ in the thermodynamic limit.) Is the vorticity (the mean number density of vortices) a 
smooth function of the temperature?</li>

<li> Look at configurations showing the vortices near the
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at $T=T_{\rm KT}\approx0.9$.  Is there any evidence that the positive 
vortices are moving away from the negative vortices? The Kosterlitz-Thouless transition is due to 
this unbinding of vortex pairs.</li>
