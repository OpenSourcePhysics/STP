<p>Previously we used the demon algorithm as an ideal thermometer, where the demon was an extra degree of freedom that 
could exchange energy with the system. A plot of the log of the demon energy distribution $\ln P(E_d)$ versus the demon energy
$E_d$ is a straight line with a slope equal to $-1/kT$. We now  also allow the demon to exchange particles with the system,
 so that a plot of  the log of the demon particle number distribution $\ln P(N_d)$ versus the demon particle number
$N_d$ for a particular value of $E_d$ is a straight line with a slope equal to $\mu/kT$.  </p>

<p> The program  simulates a simple model in one dimension where the particles have discrete values of momentum and position. A 
 single particle state is defined by
its location in a two-dimensional momentum-position phase space. To represent a dilute classical system only one 
particle per phase space point is allowed.  Attractive interactions between neighboring particles can be added and a hard core 
repulsion can be added to prevent more than one particle at the same position. 

<p> The goal of this simulation is to explore how $\mu$ depends on particle density and the effect of the interactions.
