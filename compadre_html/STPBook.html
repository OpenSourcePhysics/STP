  <h2>Statistical and Thermal Physics Programs</h2>

  <p>This collection includes all programs used in the text <i>Statistical and Thermal Physics: With Computer Applications</i>, 2nd ed., 
    Harvey Gould and Jan Tobochnik, Princeton University Press (2021). The Java programs use the Open Source Physics (OSP)
    library, created by Wolfgang Christian and supported by many other collaborators.  
       </p>
  
  <b>Program Resources and Organization</b>
   <ol>

<li> On each program page the user can run the program from their browser. Included are problems from the textbook. The programs were
      converted from Java to JavaScript by Wolfgang Christian 
      and Robert Hanson using the SwingJS system developed at St. Olaf College.</li>

    <li>Source code for all Java programs can be 
    <a href="https://www.compadre.org/OSP/document/ServeFile.cfm?ID=15436&DocID=5284&Attachment=1">downloaded</a>. 
     Each program source code appears in the chapter folder where it is first used. 
     The Java programs require the <a href="https://github.com/OpenSourcePhysics/osp">OSP</a> library to run. For some problems
    such as those using Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations of many particles, the Java programs run much faster 
    than the JavaScript or Python versions. </li>
    
    <li>Source code for all Python programs can be  <a href="https://www.compadre.org/OSP/document/ServeFile.cfm?ID=15436&DocID=5285&Attachment=1">downloaded</a>. 
     Each program source code appears in the chapter folder where it is first used. For novice programmers the Python code may be easier to
     follow and modify than the Java code. </li>
    
    <li><a href="./">Download</a> executable jar file (need to install Java on your computer to run jar files.) 
    This jar file is organized in a way similar to that of this Compadre collection. </li>
