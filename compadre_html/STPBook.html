  <h2>Statistical and Thermal Physics Programs</h2>

  <p>This collection includes all programs used in the text <i>Statistical and Thermal Physics: With Computer Applications</i>, 2nd ed., 
    Harvey Gould and Jan Tobochnik, Princeton University Press (2021). The Java programs use the Open Source Physics (OSP)
    library, created by Wolfgang Christian and supported by many other collaborators.  
    The source files for these programs can be <a href="./org.zip"> downloaded</a>. They are organized according to the 
    first chapter they are used. The OSP library must also be included.   </p>
  
  <p>The JavaScript version of these programs can be run from the web pages in the menu bar. They
  are based on the Java programs  </p>
  
  <p>Python versions of the programs are available for <a href="./pythonSTP.zip"> download</a>. 
  
  <p>Individual jar files which are created from the Java programs are found in the program web pages 
  reached from the menu bar. These versions run much faster than the JavaScript and Python versions.</p>
