<p>When the magnetic field applied to a ferromagnet changes direction, the spins within the ferromagnet do not immediately
flip to reach their typical equilibrium state. The magnetization is not just a function of the applied
magnetic field, but also depends on the current state and the rate at which the field changes. 
 This non-equilibrium behavior is called <i>hysteresis</i>.    </p>

<p> In this Monte Carlo Metropolis program the spins are initially  aligned with the magnetic field. Then slowly the field is 
reduced to zero and then changes sign and is increased in the opposite direction. The spins eventually align 
with the magnetic field in the opposite direction, and then the field is reduced to zero again, and again changes sign. 
You can explore hysteresis as a function of temperature as well as the rate at which the field is changed. </p>

<b>Problem: The Ising model in an external magnetic field </b>

<p>Go to Program
<tt>Ising2d</tt> and simulate the
Ising model on a square lattice at a given temperature. Choose
$N=L^2=32^2$. Run for at least 200 Monte Carlo steps per spin at each value of the field.

<ol type ="a">

<li>
Set $H=0.2$ and $T = 3$ and estimate the approximate value of the magnetization. Then change the field to $H = 0.1$ 
and continue updating the spins (do not press <tt>New</tt>) so that the simulation is continued from the last microstate. Note the value of $m$. Continue this procedure with $H=0$, then $H = -0.1$ and then $H=-0.2$. Do your values of $m$ change abruptly as you change the field?
Is there any indication of a phase transition as you change $H$?</li> 

<li>
Repeat the same procedure as in part (a) at $T = 1.8$ which is below the critical temperature. 
What happens now? Is there evidence of a sudden change in $m$ as you change the direction of the field?</li>

<li>
Use Program <tt>IsingHysteresis</tt> with $T= 1.8$, the initial magnetic 
field $H = 1$, $\Delta H=0.01$, and 10\,mcs for each value of $H$. The program plots the mean magnetization 
for each value of $H$, and changes $H$ by $\Delta H$ until $H$ reaches $H=-1$, when it changes $\Delta H$ to $-\Delta H$. 
Describe what you obtain and why it occurred. The resulting curve is called a <i>hysteresis</i> loop, and is 
characteristic of discontinuous phase transitions. </li>

<li>
Change the value of mcs for each value of $H$ to 1 and view the resulting plot for $m$ versus $H$.  
Repeat for mcs equal to 100. Explain the differences you see.</li>
