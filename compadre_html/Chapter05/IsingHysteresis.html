<p>When the magnetic field applied to a ferromagnet changes direction, the spins within the ferromagnet do not immediately
flip to reach their typical equilibrium state. The magnetization is not just a function of the applied
magnetic field, but also depends on the current state and the rate at which the field changes. 
 This non-equilibrium behavior is called <i>hysteresis</i>.    </p>

<p> In this Monte Carlo Metropolis program the spins are initially  aligned with the magnetic field. Then slowly the field is 
reduced to zero and then changes sign and is increased in the opposite direction. The spins eventually align 
with the magnetic field in the opposite direction, and then the field is reduced to zero again, and again changes sign. 
You can explore hysteresis as a function of temperature as well as the rate at which the field is changed. </p>
