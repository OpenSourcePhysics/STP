  <h1 id="myTitle" style="position:fixed;">Program PottsNumberOfStates</h1>


  <div style="position:absolute;left:30px;top:500px;">

  


<p>Program <tt>PottsNumberOfStates</tt> uses the Wang-Landau Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the 
number of microstates $\Omega(E)$ for each value of $E$ in the q-state 2d Potts model on a square lattice. In the Potts model 
there are $q$ possible states for each spin and the interaction energy between any pair of neighboring spins is $-J$ 
if the spins have the same value and is 0 otherwise. The 2-state Potts model is equivalent to the Ising model. 
 Once $\Omega(E)$  is known  averages 
such as the mean energy can be found at any temperature using
$$\overline{E} = \sum_E EP(E) = \frac{\sum_E E\Omega(E)e^{-E/kT}}{\sum_E\Omega(E)e^{-E/kT}}. $$   </p>

<p> The program also calculates the specific heat as a function of temperature from a single simulation. From the
energy distribution $\ln{P(E)}$ we obtain evidence for whether the phase transition is continuous or discontinuous. 
The nature of the transition depends on $q$. </p>

<b>Problem: Application of Wang-Landau algorithm to the Potts model</b>
<ol type ="a">

<li>
What is the relation of the $q=2$ Potts model to the usual Ising model? In particular, 
what is the relation of the interaction energy $K$ defined in the Potts model and the 
interaction energy $J$ defined in the Ising model? </li>

<li>
Program <tt>PottsNumberOfStates</tt> implements the Wang-Landau algorithm
 for the Potts model on a square lattice. Run the program for $L = 16$ and various values of $q$ and 
 verify that the peak in the specific heat occurs near the known exact value of the transition temperature 
 given by $T_c = (\ln{(1 + \sqrt{q})})^{-1}$. You will need more than 100,000 Monte Carlo steps to obtain 
 reliable data.</li>

<li>
Choose $q = 2$ and $q=3$ and observe the energy distribution $P(E) = \Omega(E) e^{-\beta E}$ at $T=T_c$. 
Do you see one peak or two?</li>

<li>
Choose $q = 10$ and observe the energy distribution $P(E)$ at $T=T_c$. You should notice 
two peaks in this distribution. Discuss why the occurrence of two peaks is appropriate 
for a discontinuous transition.
