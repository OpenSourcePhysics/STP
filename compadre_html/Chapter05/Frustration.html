<p>If the interaction energy $J$ in the Ising model is negative, then neighboring spins 
lower their energy by being antiparallel. Such a system is called an <i>antiferromagnet</i>.  The 2d Ising antiferromagnet
on a triangular or hexagonal lattice has some unusual properties.  Each site has six nearest neighbors, and 
it is impossible to create a microstate where every spin has only antiparallel neighboring spins. 
We say the spin is <i>frustrated</i>. The goal of this simulation is to explore the effect of frustration on the possibility for a phase transition.  </p>


<b>Problem: Ising Antiferromagnetic on a hexagonal lattice</b>
<p>Consider the Ising antiferromagnetic  on a hexagonal lattice, for which each spin has six nearest
neighbors. The ground state in this case is not unique because of
<i>frustration</i> Convince yourself
that there are multiple ground states. Is the entropy zero or
nonzero at $T=0$? ($S(T=0) = 0.3383kN$. See G. H. Wannier, &#8220;Antiferromagnetism. The triangular Ising net,&#8221;
 Phys. Rev. <b>79</b>, 357-364 (1950); erratum, Phys. Rev. B <b>7</b>, 5017 (1973).) Use Program <tt>Frustration</tt> to simulate
the antiferromagnetic Ising model  on a hexagonal lattice at various temperatures and describe its
qualitative behavior. This system does not have a phase transition for $T>0$. 
Are your results consistent with this behavior?
