<p>If the interaction energy $J$ in the Ising model is negative, then neighboring spins 
lower their energy by being antiparallel. Such a system is called an <i>antiferromagnet</i>.  The 2d Ising antiferromagnet
on a square lattice behaves almost identically to the ferromagnetic Ising model if we focus on the <i>staggered</i> 
magnetization, which is defined as $$m_s = (1/N)\sum c_i s_i,$$ where we imagine a checkerboard lattice 
with red and black squares; $c_i = +1$
on the black squares and $c_i =-1$ on the red squares. The goal of this simulation is to explore the similarities between the ferromagnetic Ising model 
and the antiferromagnetic version.  </p>

<b>Problem: Ising antiferromagnet</b>

<p>We have considered the ferromagnetic Ising model for which the energy of interaction between 
two nearest-neighbor spins is $J>0$. Hence all spins are parallel in the ground state in the ferromagnetic Ising model. 
In contrast, if $J < 0$, nearest-neighbor spins must be antiparallel to minimize their energy of interaction.

<ol type ="a">
<li> Sketch the ground state of the one-dimensional  antiferromagnetic
Ising model. Then do the same for the antiferromagnetic Ising model on a
square lattice. What is the value of $m$ for the ground state of an Ising antiferromagnet?</li>

<li> Use Program <tt>IsingAntiferromagnet</tt> to simulate
the antiferromagnetic Ising model on a square lattice for various temperatures and describe its
qualitative behavior. Does the system have a phase transition at $T>0$? Does the value of $m$ 
show evidence of a phase transition?</li>

<li> In addition to the usual thermodynamic quantities the program calculates the <i>staggered</i> 
magnetization and the staggered susceptibility. The staggered magnetization is calculated by 
considering the square lattice as a checkerboard with black and red sites so that each black 
site has four red sites as nearest neighbors and vice versa. The staggered magnetization is 
calculated from $\sum c_i s_i$ where $c_i = +1$ for a black site and $c_i = -1$ for a red site. 
Describe the behavior of these quantities and compare them to the behavior of $m$ and $\chi$ for the 
ferromagnetic Ising model.</li>
