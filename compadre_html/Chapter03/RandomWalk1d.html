<p>Program <tt>RandomWalk1d</tt> allows you to explore the properties of random walks in one dimension. Random walks are an example of a Bernoulli process for which there are two possible independent 
events (a step to the right or to the left). The distribution of walks in a particular direction is given by the <i>binomial distribution</i>. In addition, random walks are models of <i>diffusion</i>.    </p>

<b>ProblemMonte Carlo simulation of a one-dimensional random walk</b>

Program <tt>RandomWalk1d</tt> simulates a random walk in one dimension. 
A walker starts at the origin and takes $N$ steps. At each step the walker goes to 
the right with probability $p$ or to the left with probability $q = 1 - p$. Each step has the same unit 
length and is independent of the previous steps. 
Are some displacements more likely than others? 
We can simulate an $N$-step walk by the following pseudocode:
<p>do istep = 1,N
 <p> $\,\,\,\,$if (rnd <= p) then
 <p>   $\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,$x = x + 1
<p>  $\,\,\,\,$else
<p>    $\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,$x = x - 1
<p>  $\,\,\,\,$end if
<p>end do


<p>The function <tt>rnd</tt> generates a  number between zero
and one with equal probability. The quantity
$x$ is the net displacement after $N$ steps assuming that the steps are of unit
length.

<p>We average over many walkers (trials), where each trial consists of a $N$ step walk and 
construct a histogram for the number of times that the displacement $x$ is found. 
The probability that the walker is a distance $x$ from the origin after $N$ steps is proportional to 
the corresponding value of the histogram. This procedure is called <i>Monte Carlo</i> sampling.


<ol type ="a">
<li> Is the value of $x$ for one trial of any interest? Why do we have to average over many trials? </li> 

<li> Will we obtain the exact answer for the probability distribution by doing a Monte Carlo simulation? </li> 

<li> How does the histogram  change  for larger values of $N$. Assume $p=1/2$ here and in the following. </li> 

<li> What is the most probable value of $x$ for  $N = 16$ and $N = 32$?  Estimate the width of the 
distribution visually. How does the width change as a function of $N$? </li> 

<li> How does the histogram change, if at all, as the number of walkers increases for  $N=4$? </li>
