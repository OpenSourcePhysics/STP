  <h1 id="myTitle" style="position:fixed;">Program Viscosity</h1>


  <div style="position:absolute;left:30px;top:500px;">

  


<p>Program <tt>Viscosity</tt> simulates the behavior of particles moving in a three-dimensional box interacting through a Lennard-Jones potential. 
The program  uses the velocity Verlet algorithm to update the positions and velocities of the particles according to Newton's second law. 
Periodic boundary conditions are used. </p>

<p>In this program the length of the system in the $z$-direction is three times longer than the 
other two directions to allow for a better estimate of the $x$-velocity
gradient in the $z$-direction. The system is divided into slabs in the $z$-direction.  The $x$-velocity gradient is 
created by a momentum flux due to swapping the smallest $x$-velocity in a &#8220;high momentum slab&#8221; with the largest x-velocity in 
the &#8220;low momentum slab.&#8221; The viscosity is determined from the ratio of the momentum flux to the $x$-velocity gradient.     </p>

<p>To begin the simulation we first equilibrate the system at a user specified temperature. We then  stop the 
equilibration, which starts 
the swapping of velocities, creating a momentum flux and $x$-velocity gradient. </p>

<b>Problem: Simulation of the viscosity</b>

<p>Program <tt>Viscosity</tt>  uses $\eta = - \frac{P_{xz}}{(\Delta v_x/\Delta z)}$
to determine the viscosity for a system of particles interacting via the Lennard-Jones potential
with a cutoff equal to $3\,\sigma$.  The number of particles is $N=3k^3$, 
where the number of slabs in the $z$ direction is $3k$. The default values are $k=10$, $T=0.7$, and $\rho = 0.849$.
Run the program until the system reaches  equilibrium  at the desired constant value of $T$. 
(The program uses velocity rescaling.)
When the <tt>Stop equilibration</tt> button is pressed, the process of momentum transfer from slab at $z=0$
to the middle slab is started. Press the <tt>Reset Data</tt> button several times to ensure that the system has 
reached a steady state. The mean $x$ momentum in the left and right halves of the box are plotted separately 
so that you can determine how well they agree.

<ol type ="a">
<li> What is the value of the viscosity for the default values of $N$, $\rho$, and $T$?</li>
<li> How do you expect $\eta$ to change with increasing $T$ for fixed $\rho$? Test your expectation 
using Program <tt>Viscosity</tt>  by doubling the temperature.</li>

<li> How do you expect $\eta$ to change with increasing $\rho$ for fixed $T$? Test your expectation 
using Program <tt>Viscosity</tt> by increasing the density by $10\%$.</li>

<li> *Increase $N$ while keeping the density and the temperature the same as in part (a) and determine the importance of finite size effects on the 
computed value of $\eta$.</li>
