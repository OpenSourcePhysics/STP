  <div style="position:absolute;left:30px;top:500px;">

  


<p>Program <tt>DemonEinsteinSolid</tt>  models an ideal thermometer,   called the <i>demon</i>. The demon is in thermal equilibrium 
with  a system of $N$ oscillators called an Einstein solid. The energy of each oscillator is restricted to an integer and is $\geq 0$. The energy of the demon is its only property, and thus the 
energy of the demon is a label for a  microstate of the demon.</p>

<p>The demon   
randomly visits an oscillator and randomly attempts to increase or decrease its energy by $\pm 1$. 
If the change decreases 
the energy,
 the change is accepted and the lost energy goes to the demon. If the change increases the energy, 
 this change is  accepted only
if the demon has enough energy to give to cover the increase in the energy of the system. (The energy of each oscillator must be nonnegative.)</p>

<p> The goal of this simulation is to explore how the demon's mean energy 
and probability distribution are related to the temperature and to determine the temperature dependence of the energy
for an Einstein solid. The key idea is that the demon acts as a system in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir of 
Einstein oscillators, and
thus the energy distribution of the demon follows a Boltzmann distribution.</p>

<b>Problem: The demon and the Einstein solid</b>

<p>Consider a demon that exchanges energy with an Einstein solid of
$N$ particles. The demon selects a particle at random and randomly changes its energy
by $\pm 1$ consistent with the constraint that $E_{d}
\geq 0$. In this case the energy of a particle in the system also must 
remain nonnegative. Why? 
Use Program <tt>DemonEinsteinSolid</tt>  to do the simulations.

<ol type ="a">

<li> Choose
$N=40$ and various value of $E \geq 200$. What is the mean energy of the demon after
equilibrium between the demon and the system has been established? 
Plot $\overline{E}/N$ versus $\overline{E_{d}}$. Is the value of $\overline{E}/N$ 
proportional to  $\overline{E_{d}}$ as it is for an ideal gas?</li> 

<li> Compute the probability
$P(E_{\rm d})$ for various values of $E$ and $N$ and determine $-\beta$, the slope of $\ln P(E_{\rm d})$. 
How is $1/\beta$ related to $\overline{E_d}$?</li> 

<li> Why is the slope of $\ln{P(E_d)}$ independent of $E/N$?</li> 

<li> Suppose that the demon can transfer energy to and from the system easily so that most of its trial 
changes are accepted. What can you conclude about the slope of $\ln{P(E_d)}$ versus $E_d$ in this case? 
Is the temperature high or low? What can you conclude about the slope if the temperature is such that 
few trial changes are accepted?</li> 


<li> Explain why the demon's mean energy is
given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:4/edbar}
\overline{E_{d}} = \frac{\sum_{n=0}^\infty n e^{-\beta n} }{\sum_{n=0}^\infty e^{-\beta n}}.
\end{equation}
Why is the energy of the demon restricted to
integer values?</li> 

<li> Do the sums in (\ref{eq:4/edbar}) to determine
the temperature dependence of
$\overline{E_{d}}$. It is only necessary to directly evaluate the sum in the 
denominator of \eqref{eq:4/edbar}. 
The numerator can be determined by an appropriate derivative of the result for the denominator.</li> 

<li> Why is the temperature dependence of $\overline{E_{d}}$
different for an ideal gas and an
Einstein solid? </li>
