<p>Program <tt>DemonEinsteinSolid</tt>  models an ideal thermometer,   called the <i>demon</i>. The demon is in thermal equilibrium 
with  a system of $N$ oscillators called an Einstein solid. The energy of each oscillator is restricted to an integer and is $\geq 0$. The energy of the demon is its only property, and thus the 
energy of the demon is a label for a  microstate of the demon.</p>

<p>The demon   
randomly visits an oscillator and randomly attempts to increase or decrease its energy by $\pm 1$. 
If the change decreases 
the energy,
 the change is accepted and the lost energy goes to the demon. If the change increases the energy, 
 this change is  accepted only
if the demon has enough energy to give to cover the increase in the energy of the system. (The energy of each oscillator must be nonnegative.)</p>

<p> The goal of this simulation is to explore how the demon's mean energy 
and probability distribution are related to the temperature and to determine the temperature dependence of the energy
for an Einstein solid. The key idea is that the demon acts as a system in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir of 
Einstein oscillators, and
thus the energy distribution of the demon follows a Boltzmann distribution.</p>
