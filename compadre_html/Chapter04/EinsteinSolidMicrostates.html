<p>The Einsein model consists of $N$ oscillators and $E$ packets of energy 
which can be distributed among the oscillators in $\Omega$ ways, where
$$\Omega = \frac{(E+N-1)!}{E! (N-1)!}.\label{1}$$
Each way is  a  <i>microstate</i>. </p>

<p>Program <tt>EinsteinSolidMicrostates</tt> considers two systems    which can share energy; the number of
oscillators in each system is fixed. The  idea is to explore the probability of various distributions
of energy between the two systems.</p>

<b>Problem: Two Einstein solids in thermal contact</b>

<p>Consider two Einstein solids
with $N_A = 4$ and
$E_A = 10$ and $N_B = 4$ and $E_B = 2$. The two subsystems are
thermally isolated from one another and from their surroundings. Verify that the number of microstates accessible to subsystem $A$ is 286 and the number of microstates accessible to subsystem $B$ is 10. What is the initial number of accessible
microstates for the composite system?

Program <tt>EinsteinSolidMicrostates</tt> determines the number
of accessible microstates of an Einstein solid using
(\ref{1}) and will help you answer the following questions.

<ol type ="a">

<li> The internal
constraint is removed so that the two subsystems may exchange energy. Determine
the probability
$P_A(E_A)$ that system
$A$ has energy
$E_A$. Plot
$P_A$ versus $E_A$ and discuss its qualitative energy dependence.

<li> What is the probability that energy is transferred from system $A$ to system $B$ and from 
system $B$ to system $A$? 
Which system would you identify as the colder system? </li>

<li> Determine the mean energy $\overline{E}_A$, the most probable energy $\skew3\tilde E_A$, the 
standard deviations $\sigma_A$ and $\sigma_B$, and the relative fluctuations $\sigma_A/\overline{E}_A$. </li>


<li> What is the number of accessible microstates of the
composite system after the internal constraint has been
relaxed? What is the change in $S$ of the 
system (choose units such that $k=1$)?</li>

<li> The
quantity $S$ of the composite system when each subsystem is in its most
probable macrostate is $\ln \Omega_A(\skew3\tilde E_A)
\Omega_B(E_{\rm tot} - \skew3\tilde E_A)$. Compare the value of this contribution to the value of 
$S_{\rm tot} = \ln \sum_{E_A} \Omega_A(E_A)
\Omega_B(E_{\rm tot}- E_A)$.

<li> Consider
successively larger systems and describe the qualitative behavior of the various quantities.</li>
