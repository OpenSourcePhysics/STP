<h4>Molecular Dynamics</h4>
July 31, Peter Sibley

<p>Added author tags in source.</p>


July 29, Harvey Gould

<p>Added method getInstantanousKineticEnergy so that initial total energy is computed corectly. Made cosmetic changes in LJFluidApp.</p>

July 12, Peter Sibley

<p>Changed control.getDouble("Maximum for Temperature Scale") to "Maximum for Temperature axis".

<p>I fixed the lennard-jones program. You forgot to add virial = 0; at the
beginning of the accel method.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I like the long names for the variables, though it does
give a better idea what they mean.</p>

<p>Also, on the plots the fluctuations in the data look so large. I'm not
sure the y axes should be rescaled automatically. It might be more
meaningful for the temperature at least to force the y axis to begin at
0.</p>

July 10. Peter Sibley.

<p>I think the pressure fuunction is screwed up have a look at getPressure in LJfluid.java.</p>

<ul>
<li>set time plots to default to zero for their xmin.</li>
<li>altered display to show "Initial Total energy ..."</li>
<li>reset clears message box.</li>
<li>changed histogram to plot v_x.</li>
<li>changed defaults to L_x=18 , temp = 1</li>
<li>corrected the plotting window so temperature is really temperature (it was plotting pressure in that window before)</li>
<li>added output for instaneous energy in the message box.</li>
<li>added dt as a parameter.</li>
</ul>
